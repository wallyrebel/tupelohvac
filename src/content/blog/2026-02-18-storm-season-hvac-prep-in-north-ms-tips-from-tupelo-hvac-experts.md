As storm season approaches in North Mississippi, particularly in Tupelo, it’s essential to prepare your HVAC system to withstand severe weather conditions. Strong winds, heavy rain, and hail can cause damage or disrupt your cooling system, leaving your home uncomfortable and vulnerable. Proper planning and maintenance can help minimize risks and keep your HVAC running smoothly during storms.  

## Why Storm Prep Matters for Your HVAC System  

North Mississippi experiences unpredictable spring weather, with thunderstorms and tornado threats common. Storms can lead to power outages, falling debris, and moisture intrusion—all of which threaten your HVAC system’s efficiency and longevity. Preparing ahead ensures your system remains reliable and reduces repair costs.  

## Practical Steps to Prepare Your HVAC for Storm Season  

Follow this checklist to safeguard your HVAC system:  

- **Inspect and Clear Surroundings:** Keep the area around your outdoor unit free of leaves, branches, and debris that could become projectiles or block airflow during storms.  
- **Secure the Outdoor Unit:** Use sturdy brackets or supports to prevent wind damage. Cover the unit with a breathable cover if storms are expected to bring hail or heavy rain.  
- **Check Electrical Connections:** Ensure all wiring and connections are secure. Consider installing a surge protector to prevent storm-related power surges from damaging your system.  
- **Schedule Maintenance:** Have a professional inspection to identify any existing issues. Regular tune-ups can improve system resilience.  
- **Prepare for Power Outages:** Have backup power options like a generator or uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for critical components.  

**Warning Signs of HVAC Damage Post-Storm:**  
- Unusual noises during operation  
- Reduced airflow or cooling capacity  
- Water leaks or excessive moisture around the unit  
- Frequent system cycling or failure to turn on
