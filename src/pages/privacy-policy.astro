      <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> February 7, 2026</p>

      <h2>What We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        When you submit the HVAC request form, we collect the information you provide: full name, phone, email,
        optional ZIP, service type, and message. We also log submission metadata such as timestamp, page URL, and UTM
        parameters.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Use Lead Data</h2>
      <p>
        We use your data to route your request to local sponsoring HVAC service providers and for internal lead logging
        in Google Sheets. We do not promise any specific response time or service outcome.
      </p>

      <h2>Consent Language</h2>
      <p>
        By checking the consent box and submitting, you confirm: <em>"I agree to be contacted about my request."</em>
      </p>

      <h2>Disclosure for Lead Form</h2>
      <p>
        TupeloHVAC.com is a lead-generation website. Sponsored placements and provider listings are paid placements and
        are not endorsements.
      </p>

      <h2>Anti-Spam and Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use Cloudflare Turnstile, honeypot fields, and timing checks to reduce spam submissions. Basic technical
        data such as user agent and IP metadata may be processed for fraud prevention.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Lead records are retained in operational systems (email + Google Sheets) for business follow-up and reporting.
        You may request deletion by contacting
        <a href="mailto:help@tupelohvac.com">help@tupelohvac.com</a>.
